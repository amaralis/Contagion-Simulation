# Contagion-Simulation
Simulates disease propagation in a closed system and charts data in real time

This is my first project. It is intended to be an exercise in javascript. It is not intended to have portions of its code used in other applications, as full modularity had to yield before time constraints. Therefore, if you're looking for a ready-made quadtree, a chart, or some other functionality, this is not the place to be searching.
